# HTML Cheatsheet

HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Here are some tips on how to use HTML professionally:

## Structure

- Use a clear and well-organized structure for your HTML code. This will make it easier for others to read and understand your code, and help you avoid mistakes.
- Always use proper indentation to make your code easier to read and navigate.
- Use semantic HTML elements to give meaning to your code. For example, use the `<nav>` element for navigation links, `<article>` for content, and `<footer>` for the page footer.

## Best Practices

- Use valid HTML. Use a validator like the [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check your code for errors.
- Keep your HTML code separate from your CSS and JavaScript code. Use external files for CSS and JavaScript, and link to them from your HTML file.
- Use descriptive and meaningful names for your IDs and classes. Avoid using generic names like "box" or "container".
- Use the alt attribute for images to improve accessibility for visually impaired users and to improve your website's SEO.
